#Task
##A list of ideas/bullet points you would test for. Focus on good coverage, rather than complete test cases.
	-Validate that the system can add new pet.
	-Validate that the system can find pets by id.
	-Validate that the system can update pet details.
	-Validate that the system can delete pet.

##Please automate proposed test cases.
	- I am unable to finish the complete test cases due to the following impediments:
		*The creation of framework consumes lots of time due to issues in the setup of springframework.
		*I made a flexible framework that can be easily use by the team.
		*I am new in creating API framework so I do some research before I proceed with the test.
	
##A short explanation of the provided solution.
	- The solution that I made is a framework that is flexible enough for different types of API request. The idea on this is to build a structure that is easy to maintain, easy to follow, and very open to add new technolgy in API testing. I'm a bit short with the time, so I missed to configure the right features of the framework, but the script, are working and it can execute the request.

3. open intellij > File > New > Project from existing source > open APIAutomation > select the pom.xml of the project > click OK 
4. Go to src > test > Testsuite > run RegressionSuite.xml


I hope you can follow my highlevel instruction, if in case you have difficulties please let me know so I can assist you.
